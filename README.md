# Top 29 React Interview Questions and Answers

1. What is React?
   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by [Facebook](https://reactjs.org/).

2. What are the key features of React?
   - Virtual DOM
   - Component-based architecture
   - JSX
   - Unidirectional data flow

3. What is JSX? <br />
   JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. Read more about [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

4. What is virtual DOM? <br />
   Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing DOM manipulation. Learn more about the [Virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-the-virtual-dom).

5. What are components in React? <br />
   Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable, encapsulated pieces of code that render UI elements. Learn more about [Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

6. What is the difference between functional components and class components?<br />
   Functional components are simple functions that take props as input and return React elements. Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component and can have state and lifecycle methods. Read more about [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

7. What is state in React? <br />
   State is a JavaScript object that stores data that affects the rendering of a component. It can be changed over time using setState(). Learn more about [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

8. What are props in React? <br />
   Props (short for properties) are inputs to a React component. They are immutable and are used to pass data from parent to child components. Learn more about [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

9. What is the purpose of setState() method in React?<br />
   setState() is used to update the state of a component. When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated state. Learn more about [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

10. What are controlled components?<br />
    Controlled components are components whose values are controlled by React state. Their value is set by state and they notify changes through event handlers. Learn more about [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).

11. What are the lifecycle methods of a class component in React?<br />
    The lifecycle methods of a class component include componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), componentWillUnmount(), and others. Learn more about [Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

12. What is the significance of keys in React lists? <br />
    Keys are used to identify unique elements in a list. They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Learn more about [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html).

13. What is React Router?<br />
    React Router is a library that allows you to handle routing in a React application. It enables navigation between different components while maintaining a single-page user experience. Learn more about [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

14. What is the context API in React?<br />
    Context API is a feature that allows you to share data between components without having to pass props manually through each level of the component tree. Learn more about [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

15. What are higher-order components (HOC) in React? <br />
    Higher-order components are functions that take a component as input and return a new component with enhanced functionality. They are used for code reuse and logic sharing. Learn more about [Higher-Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).

16. What are hooks in React?
    Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8. Learn more about [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

17. What is useEffect() hook used for?  <br />
    useEffect() hook is used to perform side effects in function components. It replaces componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() lifecycle methods. Learn more about [useEffect()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).

18. What is useCallback() hook used for? <br />
    useCallback() hook is used to memoize functions so that they are not recreated on every render unless their dependencies change. Learn more about [useCallback()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback).

19. What is useMemo() hook used for? <br />
    useMemo() hook is used to memoize expensive calculations so that they are only computed when their dependencies change. Learn more about [useMemo()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo).

20. What is the purpose of useRef() hook? <br />
    useRef() hook is used to create a mutable ref object whose current property can hold a value that persists across renders. Learn more about [useRef()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref).

21. What is the purpose of useReducer() hook? <br />
    useReducer() hook is an alternative to useState() hook that allows you to manage more complex state logic using a reducer function. Learn more about [useReducer()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer).

22. What are the advantages of using React? <br />
    Some advantages of using React include its virtual DOM for improved performance, component-based architecture for reusability, and a large ecosystem with community support.

23. What are the limitations of React? <br />
    Some limitations of React include a steep learning curve for beginners, potential performance issues with large applications, and lack of built-in routing and state management.

24. How does React differ from other JavaScript frameworks like Angular and Vue.js? <br />
    React differs from other frameworks in its use of virtual DOM, JSX syntax, and focus on component-based architecture. Angular and Vue.js have their own approaches to building web applications.

25. What is the significance of the key prop in React? <br />
    The key prop is used to identify unique elements in a list. It helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed when rendering lists.

26. How can you optimize performance in a React application? <br />
    Performance optimization in React can be achieved by using techniques like memoization, code splitting, lazy loading, and minimizing re-renders using PureComponent or memo.

27. What is React Fiber? <br />
    React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React core algorithm. It is designed to improve the performance and responsiveness of React applications, especially for large and complex UIs.

28. What is React suspense? <br />
    React suspense is a feature that allows you to suspend rendering while waiting for some asynchronous operation to complete, such as data fetching.

29. What is the significance of SSR (Server-Side Rendering) in React? <br />
    SSR allows you to render React components on the
